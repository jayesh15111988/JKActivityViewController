# JKActivityViewController
A sample project to demonstrate the use of Activity View controller in iOS app to work with custom activities
 
While working on another project, I realized using Activity View Controller is essential for modern apps. This app is quite simple. 
It demonstarates how to use activity view controller. 

I have also added custom activities to include user preferred options. For sample app it has two custom activities.

1. Open view to show a sample view for president
2. Another one opens search activity in Safari View controller.

Feel free to add any correction/enhancements to this project through pull requests.

I have also written a blog post on how to implement `UIActivityViewController` along with custom activities.
